# neckcare
App about protecting neck.Text Only.

Goal:When we use phones,sometimes our neck do not like a straight pen due to the neck.
This can cause health issues if we last do it for a long time.

So what can we do about it?

If we can warning this problem when there is angle between neck and the gravity line.

HOW?
THE MEMS SENSORS.

Perhaps we can develope a kind of neckcare model like protecting eye model.

When the sensors detect the angle, change the screen light or send a message to warn the phone user.



I can not code it.


I searched this kind of app in Github here,there are some same name apps.
but i can not know if their logics or ideas are same as mine for now.
